# Arduino-SmartBin
This Arduino-driven smart bin acts like a small robot â€” it detects objects in its vicinity and opens the lid automatically using a servo motor. Touchless operation also provides a small extra hygiene benefit. Perfect to experiment with sensors, automation, and building an fun, interactive device.
