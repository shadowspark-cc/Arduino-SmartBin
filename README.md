# ðŸ¤– Arduino Smart Bin

A fun robotic project! This Arduino-powered smart bin reacts like a tiny robot â€” it detects nearby objects and automatically opens its lid using a servo motor. Touchless operation also adds a small hygiene benefit. Perfect for experimenting with sensors, automation, and building a playful, interactive device.

## Components
- Arduino Uno / Nano  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- Servo Motor (SG90 / MG90S)  
- Jumper Wires  
- Breadboard (optional)  
- Power Source (Battery / USB)

## How It Works
1. The ultrasonic sensor continuously checks for objects in front of the bin.  
2. When an object is detected within a certain distance, the Arduino triggers the servo motor.  
3. The servo opens the lid automatically, then closes it after a short delay.  
4. The bin can be expanded with LEDs, buzzers, or an OLED display for extra interactivity.
